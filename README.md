# Hand-Gestures-Control-

This project enables gesture-based control using hand movements, combining **Flutter** for the front-end interface and **Python** for real-time gesture recognition. The system uses computer vision techniques to detect and interpret hand gestures, enabling users to interact with devices or applications without physical touch.

* **Frontend**: Flutter (for UI and user interaction)
* **Backend**: Python (for gesture recognition using OpenCV/MediaPipe)
* **Database**: Firebase (Google) for real-time data storage and synchronization

This application is ideal for touchless interfaces, smart home systems, and accessibility solutions.
